At the same time it reminds me of some concepts that I may have missed, or barely used. In this project we used addEventListener, something that I don't remember ever using in Vanilla. Along with document.querySelector, something that I haven't used in a long time. When it comes to element selection in vanilla js I tend to use document.getElementsByClassName, or the one for id. Oh yeah and I have never used the <kbd> element/tag and the data-key binding to in HTML. Cool stuff.",
