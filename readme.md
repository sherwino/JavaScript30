## Check Out The Results

If you would like to check out some of these projects yourself, I went ahead and hosted them on [Github Pages](https://sherwino.github.io/JavaScript30/)

When you reach that page you will note that each project is going to have three options:

- Initial: The initial code and layout that was given to me
- Completed: The completed version, and my interpretation of the tasks
- Source: The source code where you could find the initial and the results ğŸ™ƒ

## Pending ğŸ™ƒ ğŸ™ƒ ğŸ™ƒ

- Homepage should have a ways to filter, search, and change layout (grid, list, detailed list) ğŸ™ƒ ğŸ™ƒ
- Normalize the footer on all pages because it is using rem some layouts have different dimensions ğŸ™ƒ
- Floating header (or sidebar) that lets you choose between the vue, angular, react, and mithril, svelte versions ğŸ™ƒ ğŸ™ƒ ğŸ™ƒ
- a11y everything, make the site accessible af ğŸ™ƒ ğŸ”¥
- i18n everything make the site available in different languages ğŸ™ƒ ğŸ™ƒ
